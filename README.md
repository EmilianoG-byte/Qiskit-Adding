# Finding elements in an array that add up to an integer

This is the solution for the screening task #1 for the 5th cohort of the QC Mentorship program


## Setup

To run the code in the jupyter notebook you first need 
create a new conda environment and activate it 

```bash
  conda create -n QUANTUM python=3
  conda activate QUANTUM
```
    
Then, you need to install the Qiskit package. This might
 vary depending on your OS and version, but in my 
 case I used:

```bash
 pip install 'qiskit[visualization]'
```
    
In order for the new environment to appear while using jupyter 
notebook, you need to set it manually:

```bash
 python -m ipykernel install --user --name QUANTUM --display-name "Python (QUANTUM)"
```
